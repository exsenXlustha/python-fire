## Deactivation of license key

To deactivate your license key, follow these steps[^2^]:

1. Go to the official website of Navitel and fill out the deactivation request form.
2. Attach a screenshot of the About program screen from your device that shows your license key.
3. Send the request and wait for an automated response with an assigned request number.
4. Do not launch the app on the old device with an active Internet connection, as it will lead to reactivation of the key and deactivation will no longer be possible.
